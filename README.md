# Dog-Breed-Classifier


* 􏰁Built a Multiclass-Multilabel image Classifier using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify different dog breeds.
􏰁
* Imported, reshaped, and converted images to Tensors to achieve faster processing speed while training and testing Deep Learning Models.

* Imported and utilized several Deep Learning models from TensorFlow Hub, used Transfer Learning on a pre-trained model, and trained over 20k images using an additional layer.

􏰁* Achieved an accuracy of 96% Using the Mobilenet V2 Keras Model.
